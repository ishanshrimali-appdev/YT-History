# YT-History

## DETAILS
This project is an attempt to solve a pain-point particular to me, and very few others. I want a clean and comprehensive log of all the music I listen to, regardless of the service (e.g., YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.). To do this, this project attempts to feed in the most raw data files available from all services. The intention is to not allow users to manually CRUD information (at least in the preliminary, log-only state of the project). Rather, users are suppoesed to upload files generated by the individual music programs.

It starts with the YouTube data dump (this provides more information than the API). This is an HTML file. ActiveStorage is used to upload the file, and Nokogiri is used to process it.

## NOTES
1. Created fresh repository to root out bugs.
2. Adding a trial branch.
3. Last trial push and merge before porting over code from previous repo.
4. Test.
5. Models made, but very complex and interdependent.

## NEXT STEPS
1. ActiveStorage is stripping away extension of file. Seems to treat it like an image. If ".html" extension is added, file opens fine.
2. Nokogiri is having trouble reading the file. Need to figure out how to get file from ActiveStorage to Nokogiri.
3. Reconsider complex erd. Perhaps move back to simple with album, artist, etc. all part of "Track" model. Later can move up to more complex, interdependent models again.
